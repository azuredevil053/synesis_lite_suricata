# UNDER DEVELOPMENT - Your feedback is welcome.

> This readme will be expanded upon, however it follows the same deployment method as [ElastiFlow&trade;](https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow). If you review that readme, you should be able deploy this solution.

sýnesis&trade; Lite for Suricata is a solution for the collection and analysis of Suricata "eve" JSON logs. This includes alerts, flows, http, dns, statistics and other log types.

## Suricata
An example configuration for the Suricata eve output is provided in `suricata/suricata.yml`.

## 
As Suricata is usually run on one or more Linux servers, the solution includes both Filebeat and Logstash. Filebeat is used to collect the log data on the system where Suricata is running, and ships it to Logstash via the Beats input. An example Filebeat prospector configuration is included in `filebeat/filebeat.yml`.

The Logstash pipeline is complete and fully functional.

Dashboards for alerts and flow logs are also complete and functional. Still on the to-do list are the dashboards for HTTP, DNS and statistics logs.

Kibana index patterns can be imported with the following commands:

```
curl -X POST -u USERNAME:PASSWORD http://KIBANASERVER:5601/api/saved_objects/index-pattern/elastiflow-* -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "kbn-xsrf: true" -d @/PATH/TO/synlite_suricata.index_pattern.json

curl -X POST -u USERNAME:PASSWORD http://KIBANASERVER:5601/api/saved_objects/index-pattern/elastiflow-* -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "kbn-xsrf: true" -d @/PATH/TO/synlite_suricata_stats.index_pattern.json
```

Kibana dashboards can be imported in the Kibana `Management` app under `Saved Objects`.
